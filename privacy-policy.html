                <h4>Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services</h4>
                <p>When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:</p>

                    <li>Transaction Information: We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promo code, we may associate your name with that person.</li>
                    <li>Usage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. </li>
                    <li>Device Information: We may collect information about school community mobile devices, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and verions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.</li>

                <h4>Important Information About Platform Permissions</h4>
                <p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the Schooltek app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Schooltek app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent. Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves provide, and the permissions we request will change over time, so we’ve created these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our users.</p>

                <p>We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example:</p>
